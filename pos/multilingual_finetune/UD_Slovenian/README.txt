Original Treebank
The Slovenian UD Treebank is based on the ssj500k treebank (Krek et al. 2013),
a balanced collection of sampled texts from the FidaPLUS reference corpus of
written Slovene (Arhar and Gorjanc 2007). The original ssj500k corpus has been
manually segmented, tokenized, lemmatized and morphosyntactically tagged within
JOS project, in which the annotation guidelines have also been developed (Erjavec et
al. 2010). Additionally, approximately one half of the ssj500k treebank
has been manually annotated for dependency relations, according to the JOS syntactic
annotation scheme. The syntactically annotated part of the ssj500k corpus
(known as ssj200k), consisting of 11,411 annotated sentences and 235,864 tokens,
has been used as the basis for conversion to the Slovenian UD Treebank.

Conversion and Size
The conversion from ssj200k to the Slovenian UD Treebank was completely automatic,
based on a large set of rules for both morphosyntactic and syntactic layer,
which include different lexical, morphological and dependency features. Due to the
specifics of the original JOS syntactic annotation scheme, not all dependency relations
from the original ssj200k treebank could be converted automatically, resulting in a
smaller UD treebank size. The current version of the Slovenian UD Treebank thus contains
7,996 sentences with 140,418 tokens taken from various text types, e.g. fiction,
non-fiction and periodicals, dating from 1990-2000. The original JOS annotations are
included as part of the POSTAG (JOS morphosyntactic tags) and MISC (JOS dependency
heads and labels) columns in the CONLLU format.


Data Split
The corpus is linearly split into training (80%), development (10%) and test
(10%) data.
