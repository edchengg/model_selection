Slovak Dependency Treebank (Slovenský závislostný korpus) was created as part
of the Slovak National Corpus at the Ľ. Štúr Institute of the Slovak Academy of
Sciences. The original annotation follows the guidelines of the Prague
Dependency Treebank (Czech), slightly modified in the spirit of Slovak
grammatical tradition. Morphological tags, lemmas and dependency relations have
been assigned manually to every word.

The present dataset is a subset of the original treebank. We automatically
selected the sentences where the two human annotators 100% agreed on the
analysis. This increases the quality and trustworthiness of the data but it
also results in selecting short sentences most of the time. An extended version
may be published in the future when manually merged and checked annotation is
available.

This subset annotated in the original PDT-like style is available separately,

UD_Slovak contains the same data with annotation converted to conform to the
Universal Dependencies guidelines. The original treebank was prepared by a team
led by Katarína Gajdošová and Mária Šimková. Selection of sentences for this
subset and conversion to Universal Dependencies was done by Dan Zeman.
