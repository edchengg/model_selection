The UD Polish treebank is based on “Składnica zależnościowa” (the Polish dependency treebank)
version 0.5. The data was first converted to the Prague dependency style as a part of HamleDT;
then it was automatically converted to Universal Dependencies (HamleDT 3.0, 2015). The first
release of Universal Dependencies that includes this treebank is UD v1.2 in November 2015. It is
essentially the HamleDT conversion but the data is not identical to HamleDT 3.0 because the
conversion procedure has been further improved.
