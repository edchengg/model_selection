The UD Portuguese treebank is based on the Bosque part of the Floresta Sintá(c)tica project.
The data were used in the CoNLL-X Shared Task in dependency parsing (2006); the CoNLL version
was taken and converted to the Prague dependency style as a part of HamleDT (since 2011).
Later versions of HamleDT added a conversion to the Stanford dependencies (2014) and to
Universal Dependencies (HamleDT 3.0, 2015). The conversion path from the original Bosque still
goes through the CoNLL-X format and the Prague dependencies, which may occasionally lead to
loss of information. The first release of Universal Dependencies that includes this treebank
is UD v1.2 in November 2015. It is essentially the HamleDT conversion but the data is not
identical to HamleDT 3.0 because the conversion procedure has been further improved.
